# TCHD_VisioProInstallScript
Script is for installing Visio Pro 2019 and o365 for users that need a new copy of visio after our move to o365.
due to the complexity of the install process I have written this script to automate the correct install process.

Prerequisietes: need a computer with previous versions of office, skype and visio uninstalled, and a license key for visio pro 2019.  The version of office 365 installed is licensed through o365 and does not need any setup
